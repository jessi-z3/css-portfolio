              <h3>Team Manager Apprentice & Lead Senior Advisor Mentor</h3>
              <h4>Apple, Inc.</h4>
              <p>November 2012-Present</p>
            </div>
            <div class="job-summary">
              <p>As a Senior Technical Advisor, I’ve handled escalated technical support interactions by assisting new and experienced advisors with their customer’s concern on calls or chats, either by providing guidance on how to resolve the situation or taking ownership of the interaction until it is resolved.
              <p>As a Class Lead Mentor for New Advisor Training, Progression Advisor Training, and Vendor Advisor Training, I would assist the classroom trainer by answering questions as a subject matter expert on tools, call drivers, resources, and expert positioning. Then when it’s time to do on the job training, I facilitate a virtual classroom and oversee that Mentors are arriving on time with no technical issues of their own, providing correct guidance to the new advisors which includes goal setting and providing coaching to meet procedural requirements and soft skill best practices. It would be my duty to assist with technical issues that may delay the class, report any irregularities to the mentor coordinators, and correct any important inaccuracies. I would often also assist in a non-supervisory mentor role, providing the guidance in the moment to advisors.</p>
              <p>Team Manager Apprentice program graduates like myself are eligible to step into a Team Manager role as a backfill to support them during time away, while completing administrative work as well as behavior and career coaching guidance, while referring to the Area Manager for disciplinary or leave of absence related issues. Team managers usually support 15-20 Advisors, meeting with each one individually at least once per month and the team as a whole weekly. We focus on providing a holistic coaching experience. </p>
              <p>Having all three positions at once requires flexibility, the ability to think clearly and prioritize while cutting through ambiguity.</p>
              <p>Key contributions:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Managed a team of approximately 20 technical support and customer service representatives with cross-skilling to support multiple business queues, also experience managing Trainers and Mentors/Coaches</li>
              <li>Onboarding new Mentors to train and coach Representatives going through training for the first time or for a new skill, so I help train the trainer, and act as an SME in the training class SME on chat and phone support Tier 1 and Tier 2 Apple ID, iCloud, iOS, MacOS, Beats, iTunes billing, Pages, Numbers, Keynote, GarageBand, Photos, and iMovie, providing support to customers, including remote desktop as needed, providing training and guidance to new and experienced advisors on issue resolution or use of internal databases or CRM, handling escalations, which requires case ownership, and submitting tickets to site support engineering as need</li>
              <li>Team player - consistently exceeds expectations in teamwork on annual performance reviews</li>
